Introduction to Data Science

I was introduced to data science in 2015 where I did MATH 210 Mathematical Computing at UBC. This folder contains two short data wrangling projects I did for the course 

Math 210 Project 1
# Pandas Tutorial

A simple tutorial/Introduction on `Python Pandas` 
# Mininum Wage Analysis (Canda)

Uses `Pandas` and performed some exploratory data analysis
