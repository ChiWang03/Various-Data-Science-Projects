Introduction to Data Science

I was introduced to data science in 2015 where I did MATH 210 Mathematical Computing at UBC. This folder contains two short data wrangling projects I did for the course 

Math 210 Project 1
- [Pandas Tutorial](https://github.com/chiwang0503/Various-Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science/Pandas%20Tutorial)
  - A simple tutorial/Introduction on `Python Pandas` 

Math 210 Project 2

- [Mininum Wage Analysis (Canda)](https://github.com/chiwang0503/Various-Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science/Minimum%20Wage%20Analysis%20(Canada))
  - Used `Pandas` and performed some exploratory data analysis 

- [AQM (Applied Qunatitative Methods)](https://github.com/chiwang0503/Various-Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science/AQM)
  - This folder contains the assignment given to when applying to AQM back in 2015. Some EDA was done with an airplane data set.
