[Mining Association Rules on the OKcupid data set](https://github.com/chiwang0503/Various-Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Association%20Rules)
- This short notebook explores the OkCupid data set by mining association rules and finding latent information about dating profiles

Unsupervised Learning

- Done for data 573: Unsupervised Learning
- Hiearchical clustering using different linkages on HouseVotes84 (mlbench) data transformed with Gower's distance
- Perforemd Factor Analysis on ability.cov data
- Using PCA and NMF on hand written digits data to decide how many components are to be kept for digit recognition.

Twitter API
- A short script that pulls twitter data from the twitter api based on a certain user.
- In this case Elon Musk's tweets were pulled. 

Plotly Dash Zillow Housing Dashboard
- Visualized Zillow's property dataset and the housing dataset from Kaggle (boston property information)
- Created a 4 tab dashboard using Plotly Dash for the visualizations
- Includes: Geolocation plots of property location, Interactive Volume bar plots, Lasso Coefficients slider plots

Various Visualizations
- Seaborn and Plotly visualizations for the SierraLeoneAIMS data set. 
- The Notebook cannot visualize interactive plotly graphs (Links are provided in the notebook for interactive purposes)

PyTorch Neural Networks
- Multiple Notebooks that uses PyTorch to explore Neural Neural Networks. 
- lab work done for data 586: Advanced Machine Learning
  - lab1: Multilayer Perceptron
  - lab2: Convolutional Neural Networks
  - lab3: Recurrent Neural Networks
  - lab4: Stochastic Gradient Descent and Regularization
