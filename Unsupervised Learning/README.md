Unsupervised Learning 1 
- Done for data 573: Unsupervised Learning 
- Hiearchical clustering using different linkage methods on the bank data set. (Continuous Variables) 
- Used `Mclust` and k-means clustering to find clusters in the lots data
- Compared the coded up k-means and built in `Mclust` for which is the better clustering method for this data based on the nature of the alogrithm and the Rand Index

Unsupervised Learning 2
- Hiearchical clustering using different linkages on HouseVotes84 (mlbench) data, transformed Categorical/Binary variables in the data with Gower's distance
- Perforemd Factor Analysis on ability.cov data 
- Using PCA and NMF on hand written digits data to decide how many components are to be kept for digit recognition.
