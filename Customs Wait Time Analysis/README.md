Note: there are some things to be fixed for the wait time comparison tables in the outlier removal notebook, it is still very messy. 

[Customs Wait Time EDA]()
* Exploratory data analysis on customs wait time 
* suggest ways to optimize efficiency for customs boarder patrol agents

[Multivariate Outlier Identification]()
* Using the PyOD libary in python to identify outliers 
* two methods used: CBLOF (K-means) Cluster Based Local Outlier Factor and K Nearest Neighbors 
* [PyOD documentation](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Two useful sources to get right into how to use this libary
