Extracting key skills from Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineer job posts
* Scraped data off of indeed using `BeautifulSoup`
* Conducted Topic modelling using `ldamallet` from `gensim` and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and LDA from `sklearn`.


Very interstingly this project requires a great understanding of the data itself. When we think of key skills of data scientists we think of natural language processing, machine vision, machine learning, etc. These are not unigrams but bigrams or trigrams. This is why preprocessing the data and running topic modelling methods using n-grams is so important in key skills extraction! Enjoy some intersting findings!
